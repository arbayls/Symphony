Attune is downloaded by all parties involved. They will choose Spheres to touch on during their negotiations, depending upon what they believe is relevant to them. i.e. Finances, household chores, emotional labor, social activities, household rules/agreements, etc.

After the Spheres are chosen, the app will offer prompts to help those involved communicate and problem-solve through each Sphere. The users will be asked to record what they agree upon.

The app will then save the usersâ€™ responses so that they can be referenced later.
